##  About Me
-  Currently working on **TacoEngine** — an experimental chess AI built for high-performance clusters.  
-  Interested in **C++**, **AI**, **neural evaluation**, and **system architecture**.  
-  Constantly trying to build stuff stronger than GPUs want to handle.  
-  Open to collaborating on chess engines, optimization, and cool weird computer science projects.

##  TacoEngine
A custom chess engine I'm developing from scratch with:
-  Cluster optimization  
-  NNUE evaluation  
-  High-performance search  
-  Experimental pruning ideas  
-  Open-source but protected development  

> It's private **for now**, but it’s shaping into something special.
